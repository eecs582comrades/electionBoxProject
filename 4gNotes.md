# Matthew Notes on Interconnectiveness

- so it looks as if the router that Ed was showing us at the office has been [discontinued](https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/ibr200/#)
- There are plenty of other routers that the company offers [which all have better functionality](https://cradlepoint.com/products/endpoints/?filter=).
### other considerations include:
- what band do we want to work off of? what are our cost considerations? we could go off of 5g, but the band is still working out some of its issues and 6g is to launch soon, likely leaving 4g in the dust. 4g routers, however, are still readily and heavily available.
- flat antennas do exist. (option [1](https://5gstore.com/product/13524_peplink_slim_22g_antenna_2x_lte5g_2x_wi-fi_1xgps_600-6000mhz_sma_black_65_ft_2m.html), [2](https://5gstore.com/product/13390_digi_ix20_gnss_antenna_active_gps_1575mhz.html), [3 (magnetic)](https://www.amazon.com/Proxicast-Magnetic-Adhesive-Omni-4G-5G-Antenna/dp/B0B9J2MHTB?gQT=1)
  - should be noted - i'm not entirely sure how good these antennas are? also many of the routers have antennas that come with the router, so any external anytenna we buy we're gonna have to test for compatability
- i mean what if we just added a HAT for the pi [like this](https://sixfab.com/product/sixfab-5g-modem-kit-for-raspberry-pi-5/)

    Attempts to detect multiple Intelligent Mail Barcodes (IMBs) in the entire image
    using open source methods.
    
    Steps:
      1. Convert the entire image to grayscale and apply a binary inverse threshold.
      2. Apply a modest morphological closing with a vertical kernel (1x3) to reconnect broken vertical segments.
      3. Use connectedComponentsWithStats to identify candidate bar regions.
      4. Filter out small or irrelevant components (including those with low vertical-to-horizontal ratios).
         (Thresholds have been lowered to allow small 'T' bars.)
      5. Group candidate bars into clusters based on their vertical proximity.
      6. For each group (candidate IMB), sort the bars by x-coordinate and classify each using four modalities:
           - F (Full): The candidate touches (within tolerance) both the group top and bottom.
           - A (Ascender): The candidate touches the group top (within tolerance) and extends downward past the middle.
           - D (Descender): The candidate touches the group bottom (within tolerance) and extends upward past the middle.
           - T (Tiny): If the candidateâ€™s height is less than about 30% of the group height.
      7. Annotate each candidate bar on a debug image with its classification.
    
    Returns:
      A list of dictionaries, one per detected IMB group, with keys:
         'pattern': The string pattern (e.g., "FADT..."),
         'bbox': The bounding box of the group (x, y, w, h),
         'bars': List of candidate bar regions in the group.
